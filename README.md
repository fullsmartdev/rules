# NodeJS rules for Bazel

**WARNING: this repo is a prototype, do not depend on it.**

https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript includes nodejs rules.

As part of discussion at https://github.com/pubref/rules_node/issues/19 this
repo represents one proposal for a nodejs bazel ruleset that could be published
in first-party bazelbuild org.
