NOTICE: install_bazel_dependencies is no longer needed,
since @bazel/* npm packages can be load()ed without copying to another repository.
See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1877
install_bazel_dependencies is harmful because it causes npm_install/yarn_install to run even
if the requested output artifacts for the build don't require nodejs, making multi-language monorepo
use cases slower.
You should be able to remove install_bazel_workspaces from your WORKSPACE file unless you depend
on a package that exposes a separate repository, like @angular/bazel exposes @npm_angular_bazel//:index.bzl
You can suppress this message by passing "suppress_warning = True" to install_bazel_dependencies()
""")
